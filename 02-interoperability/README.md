# Skill 2: Interoperability

Patterns for multi-agent communication, protocol design, and system integration.

## Status: Coming Soon

Examples for this skill are in development. Subscribe to the YouTube channel for the video release announcement.

## Planned Examples

- **A2A Protocol**: Agent-to-agent communication using Google's A2A standard
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol for tool sharing
- **Async Messaging**: RabbitMQ/Redis patterns for decoupled agents
- **Agent Discovery**: Service registry and capability matching

## Key Concepts (Preview)

- Agents need standardized ways to discover and communicate with each other
- Protocol design determines scalability and reliability
- Async messaging prevents cascading failures
- Agent cards describe capabilities for dynamic discovery
