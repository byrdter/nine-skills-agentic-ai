## Status: Coming Soon

Examples for this skill are in development. Subscribe to the YouTube channel for the video release announcement.

## Planned Examples

- **OpenTelemetry Setup**: Distributed tracing for multi-agent workflows
- **Semantic Logging**: Structured logs with LLM-specific attributes
- **Quality Metrics**: Tracking accuracy, latency, and cost over time
- **Dashboards**: Grafana dashboards for agent monitoring

## Key Concepts (Preview)

- You can't improve what you can't measure
- Distributed tracing shows the complete request path
- Semantic quality evaluation catches regressions before users complain
- Alerting on cost prevents budget surprises
