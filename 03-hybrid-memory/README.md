# Skill 3: Hybrid Memory Architecture

Patterns for vector search, knowledge graphs, and multi-tier memory systems.

## Status: Coming Soon

Examples for this skill are in development. Subscribe to the YouTube channel for the video release announcement.

## Planned Examples

- **Vector Search**: Pinecone, Chroma, and Weaviate integrations
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Neo4j for relationship-based retrieval
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combining vector similarity with graph traversal
- **Memory Tiers**: Working, episodic, and semantic memory patterns

## Key Concepts (Preview)

- Vector search finds semantically similar content
- Knowledge graphs capture relationships between entities
- Neither approach alone is sufficient - hybrid retrieval wins
- Three-tier memory mirrors how databases have worked for decades
