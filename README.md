# Nine Essential Skills for Agentic AI Strategists

Practical code examples and implementation patterns for building production-ready AI agent systems.

## About This Repository

This repo accompanies the **Nine Essential Skills for Agentic AI Strategists** video series on YouTube. Each folder contains working code examples that demonstrate the concepts covered in the videos.

**These are starting points, not production-ready solutions.** Study them, adapt them, and use them as templates for your own implementations.

## The Nine Skills

| Skill | Folder | Video | Status |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1. State Management | [01-state-management](./01-state-management) | [Watch](link) | Examples Available |
| 2. Interoperability | [02-interoperability](./02-interoperability) | Coming Soon | In Progress |
| 3. Hybrid Memory | [03-hybrid-memory](./03-hybrid-memory) | Coming Soon | In Progress |
| 4. Context Economics | [04-context-economics](./04-context-economics) | Coming Soon | In Progress |
| 5. Observability | [05-observability](./05-observability) | Coming Soon | In Progress |
| 6. Data Governance | [06-data-governance](./06-data-governance) | Coming Soon | In Progress |
| 7. Non-Human Identity | [07-non-human-identity](./07-non-human-identity) | [Watch](link) | Examples Available |
| 8. Tool Engineering | [08-tool-engineering](./08-tool-engineering) | Coming Soon | In Progress |
| 9. Agentic Security | [09-agentic-security](./09-agentic-security) | Coming Soon | In Progress |
| Capstone | [10-capstone](./10-capstone) | Coming Soon | In Progress |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Docker (for some examples)
- Cloud CLI tools (optional, for cloud-specific examples)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nine-skills-agentic-ai.git
cd nine-skills-agentic-ai

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies for a specific skill
cd 01-state-management
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use This Repo

1. **Watch the video** for the conceptual understanding
2. **Explore the code** in the corresponding folder
3. **Run the examples** to see the patterns in action
4. **Adapt the code** for your own projects

Each skill folder contains:
- `README.md` - Overview and explanation of the examples
- Working code examples with comments
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- Sample configurations where applicable

## Philosophy

These examples follow the principle of **"just enough code to demonstrate the pattern."** They're intentionally simplified to make the concepts clear. Production implementations will need:

- Error handling and retry logic
- Logging and monitoring
- Security hardening
- Testing
- Configuration management

The goal is to show you *what* to build and *why*, so you can build it *right* for your specific context.

**Remember:** The gap between demo and production is enormous. These examples help you start the journey, but production is engineering. Apply the skills. Practice the principles. Build systems that work.
